I'm **Juliya**. Just a weird chick living in Texas with access to the internet.
<br>
I'm happily married to my husband, **Eirik**. We've been together since I was 19. We have three beautiful kitties together.
<br>
I am a **self-taught** developer. I did not go to college. I never had a corporate job in this field. I did it all by myself, over many years, many projects, many mistakes. 
<br>
I started creating websites for small businesses around my area when I was 20. **Wordpress**, mostly. That's all anyone used back then. I graduated into finding my 'niche', making websites for horse farms (don't ask)
<br>
I took a long break from development during Covid, but now I am back and better than ever.

## Projects

#### Heavy Network
a non-profit organization I founded to support musicians by offering bands free static websites/platforms to find success without a record label
