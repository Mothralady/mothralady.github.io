I'm **Juliya**. Just a weird chick living in Texas with access to the internet.
<br>
I'm happily married to my husband, **Eirik**. Together we have 3 beautiful kitties. 
<br>
I am a **self-taught** developer. I did not go to college. I never had a corporate job in this field. I did it all by myself, over many years, many projects, many mistakes. 
<br>
I started creating websites for small businesses around my area when I was 20. **Wordpress**, mostly. That's all anyone used back then. I graduated into finding my 'niche', making websites for horse farms (don't ask)
<br>
I took a long break from development during Covid, but now I am back and better than ever!

## Projects

#### Heavy Network
a non-profit organization I founded to support musicians by offering bands free static websites/platforms to find success without a record label. Unfortunately, the band I was testing this with signed a record label lol, but I still want to offer this to the world. I am in the process of resurrecting this. 

#### Redheads Studio
currently, I am starting a small indie game studio in Austin, Texas with my friend, Janine May. We're creating games for the girls! Our first game is a cozy farming sim with a sinister twist!
