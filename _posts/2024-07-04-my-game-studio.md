# Announcing Redheads Studio!
<br>

Plans are in motion. 
<br>
Two best friends embark on a perilous journey to create a small, indie game studio in Austin, Texas.
<br>
We finally decided on a name...
<br>

# redheads
<br>
Get it?
<br> 
Cause, we're both...redheads.
Anyway.
<br>
Feel free to support us, me, in this attempt at becoming small business owners!

### What's Next
<br>
- **our first game!**

I'm keeping info under wraps for the time being, but trust, all shall be revealed in time. I'm super excited about this project, both Janine and I are all in 100% and have some fun things in store for anyone who supports us. 
<br>
So, stay *tuned*.
