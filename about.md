I'm **Juliya**. Just a weird chick living in Texas with access to the internet.
<br>
I'm happily married to my husband, **Eirik**. Together we have 3 beautiful kitties. 
<br>
I am a **self-taught** developer. I did not go to college. I never had a corporate job in this field. I did it all by myself, over many years, many projects, many mistakes. 
<br>
I started creating websites for small businesses around my area when I was 20. **Wordpress**, mostly. That's all anyone used back then. I graduated into finding my 'niche', making websites for horse farms (don't ask)
<br>
I took a long break from development during Covid, but now I am back and better than ever!

## Projects

#### Heavy Network
a non-profit organization I founded to support musicians by offering bands free static websites/platforms to find success without a record label. Unfortunately, the band I was testing this with signed a record label lol, but I still want to offer this to the world. I am in the process of resurrecting this. 

#### Redheads Studio
currently, I am starting a small indie game studio in Austin, Texas with my friend, Janine May. We're creating games for the girls! Our first game is a cozy farming sim with a sinister twist!
<br> 

##### Wiki Maker
for the last few years I gave myself a challenge by picking an IP and playing every single game in that IP **100%**. First it was **Final Fantasy**, in 2023 it was [**Resident Evil**](https://ninth-house-d19.notion.site/Resident-Evil-HQ-3809f680921542d18b730fc0520d4eeb?pvs=74), and in 2024 it is **Dark Souls**. For some reason I felt the need to make my own wikis in this quest, you can view them if you like:
- [Dark Souls II](https://ninth-house-d19.notion.site/Dark-Souls-2-SotFS-9a5b77831f2b49d88bdafa7e46eef45b?pvs=4)
- [Dark Souls](https://ninth-house-d19.notion.site/Dark-Souls-Remastered-6ecfb616448e42fabbdfa9fcbfe1b978?pvs=74)
- [Resident Evil Revelations](https://ninth-house-d19.notion.site/Revelations-Guides-e213c7fa246b427eb977b1eb6a3f9b97)
- [Resident Evil Revelations 2](https://ninth-house-d19.notion.site/Revelations-2-Guides-9b559ba07a094dffa151b178f429075c)
